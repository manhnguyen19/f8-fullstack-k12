    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>

    <p>
      This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about cooking technique called
      <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerde the
      food(usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a wter bath thar is aprecisele
      set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his
      book, <i>Cooking fir Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter describes ir as " ultra-low
      temperature poaching".

      <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>.To reserve a seat ar the
      chef table, contact us before November 30.
